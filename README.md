Question:

Q1: In section 6.7, it said that " Based on the results of the Ripley’s K analysis earlier, we can see that we are getting clustering up to a radius of around 1200m, with the largest bulge in the graph at around 700m. Therefore, 700m is probably a good place to start and we will begin by searching for clusters of at least 4 points…". 

I was wondering how to know and see from the graph that we are getting clustering up to a radius of around 1200m, with the largest bulge in the graph at around 700m? 

A: Look at the slop of the red line to find the largest bulge in the graph ==> find the maximum slope.
